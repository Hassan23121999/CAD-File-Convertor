# CAD File Converters

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to convert 3D model files between different formats. The tools provided here allow for efficient batch conversion from OBJ to STL formats, and from STL to STEP formats, enabling compatibility across different CAD systems and 3D modeling software.

## Features

- **OBJ to STL Conversion:** Batch convert `.obj` files to `.stl` format with specified naming conventions for easy organization.
- **STL to STEP Conversion:** Transform `.stl` files into `.step` format to accommodate a broader range of CAD applications.

## Getting Started

To use these conversion scripts:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hassan23121999/CAD-File-Converters.git


2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter OCC-Core


4. Note: Additional dependencies may be required for the `obj2stl` and `OCC-Core` modules.

3. Run the conversion scripts:
- For OBJ to STL conversion:
  ```
  python Converter_OBJ_file_to_STL_file.py
  ```
- For STL to STEP conversion:
  ```
  python Converter_STL_file_to_STEP_file.py
  ```

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions that improve the scripts or add new features. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and create a pull request with your updates.
